1. BERTopic has randomeness with significant variations from multiple computations (for 2023's contemporaneous returns, two computations give $R^2$ of 5\% and 8\% repsectively).
2. Future returns' $R^2$ are much lower than contemperaneous returns'
3. Outliers in BERTopic are much more than topics (10* even 100* more)
4. $R^2$ of BERT 2023 future returns, with Vectorize model: 
   min_df=0.1, max_df = 0.9: 0.15%
   min_df=0.05, max_df = 0.95: 0.087%
   in_df=0.15, max_df = 0.85: 0.091%
